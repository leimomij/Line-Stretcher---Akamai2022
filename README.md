# Line-Stretcher---Akamai2022
Summer 2022 Akamai Internship project: control system for the EHT (Event Horizon Telescope) Greenland Telescope's Fiber Optic System. I was working for ASIAA and the SMA. All codes and programs included are for the software servo PID algorithm that controls a Line Stretcher, correcting for phase drift in the fiber optic system.
